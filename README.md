About the project Part II - A little history
===

This project was developed by me and Tiago Garcia while we were taking the "Information Retrieval and Management" 
course at Instituto Superior Técnico. The name of the project - RGI - stands for the original (and portuguese) name
of this course: "Recuperação e Gestão de Informação". Somehow we managed to get some meaningful name from the
course's initials. Yes, we are that awesome.

About the technology
=====================

For this project we used:
- Python (2.7) - The backbone of the application, where it all happens. Literally.
- jQuery / jQuery UI- For dealing with the client side scripts and UI.
